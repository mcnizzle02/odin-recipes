    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Finally, a real deep dish pizza that will make you think that you just walked out of a pizza shop in downtown Chicago. It is that good.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/8 cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup corn oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>butter as needed, for greasing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough hold together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To Make the Pizza:</h3>
    <p>Add cheese, toppings, and tomatoes that you've flavored with garlic, basil, oregano, etc. Bake the pizza in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, depending on your oven. You can prebake the crust for 10-15 minutes before adding toppings if desired.</p>
