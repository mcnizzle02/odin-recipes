    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These air fryer potato slices, served with a beer ketchup dipping sauce, are a tasty finger food somewhere between a French fry and a potato chip. Do take the time to make the dipping sauce—it’s worth it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beer</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 baking potatoes unpeeled</li>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ketchup, beer, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and cayenne in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and cool. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the basket with cooking spray or line with a disposable parchment liner.</li>
        <li>Slice potatoes 1/4-inch thick (use a mandoline if you have one), and place in a bowl. Spray potatoes with olive oil spray, and sprinkle with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Give the potatoes a good stir.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a single layer in the air fryer, and cook, shaking occasionally, until they start to crisp up a bit and turn golden brown, 14 to 17 minutes. Cooking times can vary depending on the brand and size of the fryer, and you may have to cook in batches.</li>
        <li>Remove from the fryer, and serve with beer ketchup dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
